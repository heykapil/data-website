**Disclaimer:** These are my personal views evaluating the current status of the farmers protests, their demands and government stance on this issue. Some may agree or disagree fully (or partially) with these but i welcome the comments.

Let me clarify a few things before we begin and you say me biased to any of the side. I belong to a Jat farmer family in Mathura, Western Uttar Pradesh.  In our 40â€“45 beegha fields, we cultivate wheat and mustard as Rabi crops and moong, jowar, and bajra as kharif crops. Because of the Yamuna River's monsoon floods in the Khadar sections, paddy is only planted in the Bangar areas here. Not affiliated to any political party.

What is MSP the farmers are protesting for ?







 - What are the other demands of farmers ?
 - Why only Punjab farmers there on the roads ?
 - Is this different from other protests ?
 - Is such protest happening only in India ?
 - Is this politically motivated ?
 - Are protestors Khalistanis ?
 - Fake News amid Social media 
 - Account suspension by government
 - Punjab vs Haryana !
 - Politics of Delhi in this protest ?
 - 
 - Conclusions
