*Examples:*
1. $\csc(1/z)$ on the punctured disc $0<|z|<1$ has infinite no. of poles. 
2.  $\pi^2/\sin^2(\pi z)$ has poles at set of integers $\Z$.

**We say a function on $\C$ is meromorphic on the extended complex plane $\C_{\infty}$ if it does not have an essential singularity at $z=\infty$.**

The below proposition is analogous to the relationship between set of integers $\Z$ and field of rational numbers $\Q$ as the quotient field of integers.


> [!theorem] Proposition
> The space of meromorphic functions forms a field with operations defined above.
