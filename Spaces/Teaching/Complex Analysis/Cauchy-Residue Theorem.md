This theorem establishes a relation between the integral of a function over a contour and its residue at the singularity inside the contour. The residue is a complex number that characterises the behaviour of the function near the singularity. The theorem states that the integral of the function around the contour is equal to 2Ï€i times the sum of the residues of the function at the singularities inside the contour. This theorem is a fundamental tool in complex analysis and has applications in many areas of mathematics and physics.

title: **Cauchy's Residue Theorem**


Let $f(z)$ be a function that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour $C$. Then, the integral of $f(z)$ around $C$ is equal to $2\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ at its singularities inside $C$.
```

*Proof:*
Let $z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n$ be the singularities of $f(z)$ inside $C$. We can construct a set of $n$ small circles $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n$ around each singularity, such that the circles are disjoint and lie entirely inside $C$.

Using the Cauchy Integral Formula, we have:

$$\int_C f(z) dz = \int_{C-C_1-\cdots-C_n} f(z) dz + \sum_{k=1}^n \int_{C_k} f(z) dz$$

The integral over $C-C_1-\cdots-C_n$ is analytic, so it is equal to zero by Cauchy's Integral Theorem.

For each circle $C_k$, we can choose a point $z_k$ inside the circle such that $f(z)$ has a singularity at $z_k$. Then, the integral over $C_k$ is equal to $2\pi i$ times the residue of $f(z)$ at $z_k$.

Therefore, we have:

$$\int_C f(z) dz = \sum_{k=1}^n 2\pi i \operatorname{Res}(f(z), z_k)$$

which proves the Cauchy Residue Theorem.
