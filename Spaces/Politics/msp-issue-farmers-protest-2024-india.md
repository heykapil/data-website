Let me clarify a few things before we begin and you say me biased to any of the side. I belong to a Jat farmer family in Mathura, Western Uttar Pradesh.  In our 40–45 beegha fields, we cultivate wheat and mustard as Rabi crops and moong, jowar, and bajra as kharif crops. Because of the Yamuna River's monsoon floods in the Khadar sections, paddy is only planted in the Bangar areas here. Not affiliated to any political party. 

I have a lot of questions for the discussion in this post and will try to keep these things up to date with further questions as things unfolds!

 1. Are protests legal in a democracy ?
 2. What is that MSP, farmers are protesting for ?
 3. What are the other demands of farmers ?
 4. Timing of this protest: Just before the general elections ! 
 5. Why only Punjab farmers there on the roads ?
 6. How is this different from other farmer protests ?
 7. Is such protest happening only in India ?
 8. Is this politically motivated ?
 9. Are protestors Khalistanis ?
 10. Fake News amid social media.
 11. Account suspension by government.
 12. Punjab vs Haryana !
 13. Politics of Delhi in this protest ?

## 1. Are protests legal in a democracy ? 

Yes, protests are legal in a democracy. In fact, in the Republic of India, it's one of the fundamental right, Right to protest under Article 19(1). Citizens of a democracy have the right to object, criticize, and voice their opinions to the government if they believe that any law, policy, or action taken by the government is inappropriate or arbitrary[^1] Citizens have the right to assemble without weapons, hold public meetings, and freely express their opinions. Farmers being the Citizens of India, have the right to gather in numbers for a peaceful protest, express their problems, and voice for the fulfilment of the political promises made to them, against the government.


## 2. What is MSP, farmers are protesting for? 

MSP stands for minimum support price, the minimum price at which government or private players should procure the crops of the farmers. It acts as a safety net for the farmers while they sell their crops[^2]
